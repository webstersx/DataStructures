# Data Structures
A Swift 2.0 implementation of Data Structures described in [Algorithms 4th Edition (R. Sedgewick &amp; K. Wayne)](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

A rough idea of what will be implemented (or build upon other data structures):
- Linked List
- Bag
- Queue
- Stack
- Priority Queue (min/max)
- Binary Tree
- Graph, Directed Graph, Weighted Graph

These Data Structures will be used to develop Algorithms inside of a sister-repository: [Algorithms](https://github.com/webstersx/Algorithms)
